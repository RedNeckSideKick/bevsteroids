# Bevsteroids

## Overview
This is an implementation of the classic game of Asteroids in the Bevy game
engine. I am using this as a project to learn both Rust and Bevy by implementing
a simple game, similar to the way I learned early on in my programming career
with scratch.mit.edu.
With any luck, this project might help someone else learn something too.
